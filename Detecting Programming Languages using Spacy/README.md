# Detecting-programming-languages-using-spacy

### What is Spacy:
- Spacy : is an open-source software library for advanced natural language processing, written in the programming languages Python and Cython.The library is published under the MIT license and its main developers are Matthew Honnibal and Ines Montani, the founders of the software company Explosion.

- Unlike NLTK, which is widely used for teaching and research, spaCy focuses on providing software for production usage. spaCy also supports deep learning workflows that allow connecting statistical models trained by popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch or MXNet through its own machine learning library Thinc. Using Thinc as its backend, spaCy features convolutional neural network models for part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, text categorization and named entity recognition (NER). Prebuilt statistical neural network models to perform these tasks are available for 17 languages, including English, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Chinese, and there is also a multi-language NER model. Additional support for tokenization for more than 65 languages allows users to train custom models on their own datasets as well.

### About the project :

- This project is  direct application of detecting programming languages using spacy.It is for learning goals and does not aim to obtain the best results.
- This projects highlights the importance of using spacy to detect Programming Languages and shoes the difference between classical text processing and Natural Language processing.
