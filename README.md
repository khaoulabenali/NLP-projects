### What Is Natural Language Processing?

- Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.

- The study of natural language processing has been around for more than 50 years and grew out of the field of linguistics with the rise of computers.

- Given the importance of this type of data, we must have methods to understand and reason about natural language, just like we do for other types of data.

### How Does Natural Language Processing Work?
- In natural language processing, human language is separated into fragments so that the grammatical structure of sentences and the meaning of words can be analyzed and understood in context. This helps computers read and understand spoken or written text in the same way as humans.

- Here are a few fundamental NLP pre-processing tasks data scientists need to perform before NLP tools can make sense of human language:

    * Tokenization: breaks down text into smaller semantic units or single clauses
    * Part-of-speech-tagging: marking up words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, etc
    * Stemming and lemmatization: standardizing words by reducing them to their root forms
    * Stop word removal: filtering out common words that add little or no unique information, for example, prepositions and articles (at, to, a, the).

Only then can NLP tools transform text into something a machine can understand.
