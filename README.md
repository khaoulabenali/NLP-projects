### What Is Natural Language Processing?

- Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, is broadly defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, like speech and text, by software.

- The study of natural language processing has been around for more than 50 years and grew out of the field of linguistics with the rise of computers.

- Given the importance of this type of data, we must have methods to understand and reason about natural language, just like we do for other types of data.
